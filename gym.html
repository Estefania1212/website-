    I started my fitness journey a couple of years ago for many reasons. It helped me mentally and showed me that my body could become a better version of myself. I have learned that sometimes we limit ourselves and forget that even when our minds tell us we are not capable, our bodies and our inner selves are saying, 'Yes, we can. Yes, we can be the best. Yes, we are able. Yes, this is our moment.' It has taught me that there are no limits to becoming a better version of ourselves.
