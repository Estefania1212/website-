    I have a great love for books; I feel they are wonderful companions whether you're feeling sad, happy, or disappointed. I love historical novels, but I also enjoy romantic, geopolitical, and economics books. Some of my favorite writers are Carlos Ruiz Zafón, Isabel Allende, Gabriel García Márquez, Santiago Posteguillo, Noam Chomsky, Ken Follett, and Sarah Lark.
